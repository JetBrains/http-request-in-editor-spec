The document describes the HTTP Request in Editor format designed to provide a simple way to create, execute and store information about HTTP requests. The specification mostly repeats [RFC 7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3) with several extensions intended for easier requests composing and editing.
